# TCAS
The Air Traffic Control System (TCAS) project aims to simulate a safety-critical system that manages aircraft within controlled airspace. The primary objective is to ensure safety, efficiency, and minimal human error by supporting controller decision-making through real-time aircraft tracking, conflict detection, and communication support.
